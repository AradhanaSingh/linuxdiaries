grep searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name)
for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep prints the matching lines.

grep -Ril --perl-regexp "\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b" /root/
//grep with regular expression , will look for pattern which digits followed by hypen, followed by 4 , then hyphen and 3 more
//Example 898-772-9878

 grep -Ri --perl-regexp "\b\(?\d{3}\)? \d{3}-\d{4}\b" 
 //(564) 848-9898

grep foo file 
returns all the lines that contain a string matching the expression "foo" in the file "file"

grep -ir "find_word" /etc/
#ignore case and recursive

-h
#remove file name in the result

grep -w "dhcp" folder
#just look for whole word only

grep -n 'root' /etc/passwd
#-n option to precede each line of output with the number of the line in the text file from which it was obtained

grep -v "find_word" /etc/passwd
#invert match, match lines which do not contain "find_word"

grep -l "find_word" --color /etc/passwd
#list file name which contains "find_word" , --color inlcudes color

In a file word UNIX is appearing many times? How will you count number?
grep -c "foo" foo.txt
